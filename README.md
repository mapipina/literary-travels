# Literary Travels
Embark on a literary journey by searching for books inspired by your travels. 

## Updated Vision
Rather than connect to Goodreads API (was not given me the results I wanted anyhow), going to use AI (depending on my research) to help users with their search. This project will involve a user portal in which users can 
1. Conduct search for books based on upcoming trip
2. "Pin" book to location (will start with US for easy map viz setup and catering to first tier audience)
3. Data Tables will display
    - Book Title, Country, Aggregated Rating, User Rating
4. I'm mulling through a GoodReads / alternative type of experience where they can store reviews for books as well as their rating. 
5. Thinking through a UI for logged in users to share a peek of their current literary travel reading "project" to peers, as READ-ONLY

Still thinking through the entire plan for this but the original phases for this project are no longer relevant.
